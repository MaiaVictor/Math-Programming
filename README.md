# Math Programming
A recreation of my old math projects on Scratch, along with other math-themed projects.
In order to use the Python projects with GUIs, rename them to the initials as imported in GUI.py.
To use them without GUIs, set every "return" to "print" and uncomment the bottom lines.
Use IDLE for Python, Code::Blocks for the C and C++ (with MinGW on Windows), Visual Studio for Visual Basic, and the JRE with the batch file provided for the Java.
If using Visual Studio, convert all stdio to stdafx headers for C++. Also, ensure that C++11 or higher is selected.
