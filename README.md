# Math Programming
A recreation of my old math projects on Scratch, along with other math-themed projects.
In order to use the Python projects with GUIs, rename them to the initials as imported in GUI.py.
To use them without GUIs, set every "return" to "print" and uncomment the bottom lines.
Use Visual Studio for the Windows C++ and Visual Basic, and the JRE with the batch file provided for the Java.
Run the Linux C++ files using Code::Blocks and GCC.
